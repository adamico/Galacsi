      And a dci exists
    When I go to the dci page
      And I follow "Rajouter une fiche"
      And I submit
    Then a fiche should exist with user: the user

  Scenario: a contributeur can only edit his own fiches
    Given I am logged in as a contributeur
      And another user exists
      And a dci exists
      And the following fiches exist:
        |  dci    | user          |
        | the dci | the 2nd user  |
    When I go to the dci's fiche's page
    Then I should not see "Modifier cette fiche"

  Scenario Outline: show edit link unless "valide" or "en_attente"
    Given I am logged in as a contributeur
      And a dci exists
      And a fiche exists with dci: the dci, state: "<state>"
    When I go to the dci's fiche page
    Then I should <action> "Modifier"
    Examples:
      | state     | action  |

      | a_valider | see     |
      | valide    | not see |
